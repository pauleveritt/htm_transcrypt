# Universal Python with Transcrypt and htm.py

From [this gist by Joachim Viide](https://gist.github.com/jviide/7f2746e02897505ad46b00e7c28af9e0)

Run:

```shell script
$ python ./run_server.py
```

...then go to http://127.0.0.1:5500

As you edit `main.py`, everything recompiles and the browser reloads.
